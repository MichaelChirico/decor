## Current state

decor generally solves the problem it was intended to solve, e.g. 'normally' annotated functions are parsed properly.
The open issues generally revolve around special cases like having comments in the argument list, different ways of specifying constant references, and improved error messages when parsing fails for whatever reason.

I think work could be done to address these things, but it is somewhat low priority, as there are simple workarounds (just don't use these special formats).
